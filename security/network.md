# Network

## Transmitting Data on the Network

### Data 

- Volunteer data: data that you offer yourself,is created and explicitly shared by individuals.
- Inferred data: data that generate by activities,is based on analysis of volunteered or observed data.
- Observed data: data that is captured by recording the actions of individuals.

### 3 common methods of signal transmission

- Electrical signals
- Optical signals
- Wireless signals

## Speed

The rate of data transfer is usually discussed in terms of **bandwidth** and **throughput**.

### Thoughput

- Throughput is the amount of data sent and received 

  over a connection, including any delays that might occur. 

  This includes delays in both directions.

### Bandwidth

- Bandwidth is the capacity of a medium to carry data. 

- Digital bandwidth measures the amount of data that can flow from one place to another in a given amount of time. Bandwidth is typically measured in the number of bits that (theoretically) can be sent across the media in a second.

- Common bandwidth measurements are: kb/s, Mb/s, Gb/s
